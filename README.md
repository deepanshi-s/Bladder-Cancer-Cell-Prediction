# Bladder-Cancer-Cell-Prediction
######Abstract: Detection of Bladder Cancer is done by image analysis of KI-67 immuno-stained tissue sections. KI-67 helps in the easy differentiation of malignant (red) and benign cells (blue). The percentage of malignant cells allows doctors to measure the extent of bladder cancer and act accordingly. This report includes semantic segmentation algorithms using deep learning architectures on KI67 stained images. The classifier detects the positive tumour cells and calculates the KI Index. Manual annotation of images using Adobe Photoshop was done to provide the ground truth images. Literature survey was done to decide upon the best model. A 3-class classifier model was trained and tested. A GUI was created to display the original tissue image, predicted image and the corresponding KI Index.
######Problem Statement: KI 67 Cancer Detection Test is widely used to determine the proliferation index from the stained tissue images. However, it is a manual process, thereby reducing the efficiency and delaying the process. We aim to provide an automated solution to this problem.
